This is a reposity for the website I created to visualize data from spherical viruses as a part of my SIP research under
Dr.Wilson at Kalamazoo College

On the top left you can click the hamburger icon to open up a search for specific virus data

Clicking any of the center icons will let you make a graph of that type (scatter, bar, pie, heatmap), initialized with
random data. To filter out certain viruses, use the filter dropdowns above the graph (if none are checked then nothing
is filtered; if at least one box is checked in a dropdown then all checked boxes are included and others are
excluded). Click the refresh button on the top left to update the graph. For selection of discrete categories (e.g.
you want to show Tnumbers 1 & 3 on a bar graph), change the axis dropdown to the category - tnumber - and select the
tnumbers that you want to be included in the filter dropdown.
